# Flying Etiquette Survey Visualization

> I chose **“Is it rude to ask someone to switch seats with you in order to be closer to friends?”** because it’s something I sometimes think about when I'm flying on a plane, this is something people react very differently to. I was curious whether most people are okay with it or if they see it as wrong.

> The chart I created shows that a majority of people **(over 600 respondents)** don’t think it’s rude at all to ask, while a smaller group said it’s somewhat or very rude. I found it interesting how accepting people are overall, even though switching seats can sometimes be pretty inconvenient.
